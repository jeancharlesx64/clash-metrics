# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in the security of my GitHub project! This policy describes how to report security vulnerabilities and what to expect when doing so.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security vulnerability in my project, please follow these steps:

1. **Send a private email or create an issue**:  create a public issue in the repository or send an email to jean.albuquerque@sptech.school with the details of the vulnerability.

2. **Include Details**: Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Possible solutions or mitigations, if you have any

3. **Response Time**: I commit to responding to your message within some days.

## Handling Vulnerabilities

1. **Assessment**: I will assess the reported vulnerability to understand its severity and impact.

2. **Fix**: Depending on the severity, I will work on a fix as quickly as possible. For critical vulnerabilities, a fix will be prioritized.

3. **Communication**: After resolving the vulnerability, I will notify the reporter and release an update in the repository. If applicable, a security advisory will be issued.

4. **Credit**: I will give credit to the reporter for discovering the vulnerability unless the reporter prefers to remain anonymous.
